#   the task

governments around the world are releasing a huge amount of open data on everything from spending through to crime and health. it is now possible to compare national, regional and city-wide data from hundreds of locations around the world.

however, the data is often just released in tabular form and this is not always the best way of presenting the data. your task in this assignment is to pick one dataset from any government open data website and create an application that dynamically provides a visualisation for that data that makes it much easier to understand the impact of the data.

your application must contain the following:

*   a client application (website)
*   a server component
    *   web service that implements a REST or SOAP API 
    *   retrieve data to be visualised from a relational database
    *   data must be transferred between the client and the web service in either JSON or XML format.
*   visualisation must be generated dynamically at run-time using data supplied by the web service
*   all server components (both web service and any server components of the website) must be written in PHP and published on the ubuntu vm

you must also include with your submission a report about your site that includes the following:

*   the url of your website
*   the url of the source of the original data
*   a description of any particularly innovative features of your application or the visualisation created
*   an implementation log/diary that details the work done on this assignment.

submission:

*   100458008.zip containing all the source code for the application
*   report in pdf format
